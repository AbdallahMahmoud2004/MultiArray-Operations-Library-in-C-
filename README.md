# MultiArray Operations Library in C++

A C++ library that provides a versatile `MultiArray` class template for handling multi-dimensional arrays. This project applies **templates** and **exception handling** as part of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, offering a range of operations such as sorting, merging, reversing, and subarray creation.

## Features
- **Template-Based Design**: Allows flexible support for arrays of different data types.
- **Exception Handling**: Includes custom exception handling for invalid operations and memory management.
- **Multi-Functionality**:
   - Load data from external files.
   - Create subarrays dynamically.
   - Sort, reverse, and search array elements.
   - Merge and split arrays with ease.

## Installation
To use this library, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
